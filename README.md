# HR Analytics Dashboard
### Project Overview
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard created using HR analytics datasets sourced from Kaggle. The goal of the project is to analyze various HR-related factors such as employee attrition, satisfaction, promotion rates, and other key performance indicators (KPIs).

The dashboard provides insights into data-driven HR decision-making and offers visualizations to help understand trends, patterns, and opportunities within an organization’s workforce.

### Key Features
Employee Attrition Analysis: Identify trends and factors contributing to employee attrition.
Performance Evaluation: Analyze performance ratings and their impact on promotion and salary increments.
Satisfaction Levels: Explore employee satisfaction across departments, roles, and locations.
Workforce Demographics: Insights into gender, age, and other workforce-related demographics.
Promotion and Retention: Examine promotion history and retention rates.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains various HR metrics such as employee job satisfaction, performance, tenure, salary, and demographics. This data is used to create meaningful and actionable insights that can assist HR departments in decision-making.
